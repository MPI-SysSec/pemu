This is the repository for the artifacts of the paper "Protocol-Aware Firmware Rehosting for Effective Fuzzing of Embedded Network Stacks".
We aim to publish the fully functional github version of this artifact shortly after the publication of the paper at the CCS 2025 conference (13.10 - 17.10.25).

In the meantime you can already have a look at the CCS artifact: https://zenodo.org/records/17035985.
